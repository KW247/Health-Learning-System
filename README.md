# Health-Learning-System

This poster illustrates elevation data integrated into a Learning Health System framework, highlighting how geographical factors like altitude may influence health outcomes. By mapping elevation variations, the study supports data-driven decision-making for public health strategies, especially in regions where topography impacts access to care, disease prevalence, or environmental exposure.
